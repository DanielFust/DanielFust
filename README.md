# Hi, Iâ€™m @DanielFust
I am a current PhD student in the Computational Flow Physics (CFP) lab at Oregon State University. I primarily develop CFD and applied numerical analysis codes in Fortran and C++

## Present research interests include:
- Sharp-interface immersed boundary methods
- Turbulent transport in hyporheic flows
- Reduced order modeling and machine learning
- Higher order conservative methods for convective problems such as EG and DG
